# Sightings Ecosystem

The Sightings Ecosystem gives cyber defenders visibility into what adversaries are
actually doing in the wild. With your help, we are tracking MITRE ATT&CK® techniques
observed to give defenders real data on technique prevalence. With this data, we can
analyze trends in evolving adversary behaviors, and ultimately provide a data-driven
resource to support prioritizing defensive operations. This project ingests ATT&CK
technique sightings and process them to produce useful datasets and reporting.

You can be a part of the success of this project by contributing your Sightings data and
help advance the state of cybersecurity at large. To join us, please submit a [Data

## Getting Started

To get started, we suggest skimming the documentation to get familiar with the project.
Next, you may want to try creating your own attack flows using the Attack Flow Builder,
which is an easy-to-use GUI tool. When you are ready to dive deep, review the Example
Flows and JSON Schema for the language.

## Background

Defenders need data driven answers to questions like:

- How do I know which techniques to prioritize?
- As a company in the finance sector, do the attackers I face use different tactics from
  those facing retail or healthcare?
- How are attacks trending over time? Are older forms of attacks still in use?
- Which techniques should I expect to see preceding and proceeding a specific attack?

We believe that a different type of cyber threat intelligence must be shared in order to
serve this purpose, and the Center is well-positioned to work across industry.
Specifically, security teams, vendors, ISACs/ISAOs, and governments should begin to
share sightings of ATT&CK techniques. In other words, they should share when they see
adversaries use specific behaviors against real production systems and networks.

## Getting Involved

- **Review the project website.** The project provides a detailed analysis of our
  findings and can have immediate impact on the prioritization of cybersecurity
  controls.
- **Analyze the underlying data.** We make the dataset freely available so that you can
  conduct your own analysis. If you generate any new insights, we would love to hear
  about it.
- **Become a data contributor.** Submit a [Data Contributor
  Request](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/sightings-ecosystem/#CFP)
  form and help us make Sightings even better!
