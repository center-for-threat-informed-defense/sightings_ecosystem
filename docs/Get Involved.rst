Get Involved
==================================
While we are always looking for more contributors for the Sightings Ecosystem project, it is a tricky balance between encouraging maximum contribution and imposing more stringent rules on data contribution. This is why our data model has optional fields, even if the data would provide added benefits and additional analysis. This iteration, we decided to include analysis of these areas, despite only having a small sub-set of data with that information. In future iterations, we hope to receive more data labeled with the optional data fields, allowing us to continue to provide new and better analysis. Our data model will also continue to change as we determine important and relevant fields for analysis. We hope to continue expanding the Sightings Ecosystem to provide insights and analysis to better inform the cyber security community.
