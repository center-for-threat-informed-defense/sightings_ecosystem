Of all techniques observed between 1 August 2021 to 30 November 2023, the top 15 most observed techniques comprise 82 percent of our sightings. This is lower than our last report, where the top 15 techniques comprised 90 percent of all observed techniques. This difference is likely due to the larger data set analyzed for this report, as well as a wider array of unique techniques seen during this timeframe.

Top 10 NIST 800-53 Controls
----------------------------
Using the Centerâ€™s mappings of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 revision 5 to ATT&CK, we can identify which NIST controls are the most effective in protecting against our top 15 techniques. Overall, Access Control, System and Information Integrity, and Configuration Management controls are the most frequently seen.  

1.	SI-3 Malicious Code Protection
2.	SI-4 System Monitoring
3.	CM-6 Configuration Settings
4.	CM-2 Baseline Configuration
5.	AC-3 Access Enforcement
6.	AC-6 Least Privilege
7.	CM-7 Least Functionality
8.	SI-7 Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity
9.	CA-7 Continuous Monitoring
10.	AC-2 Account Management
