Sightings Ecosystem |version|
=============================

This project is intended to give cyber defenders visibility into what adversaries are
actually doing in the wild. With your help, we are tracking MITRE ATT&CK® techniques
observed to give defenders real data on technique prevalence. With this data, we can
analyze trends in evolving adversary behaviors, and ultimately provide a data-driven
resource to support prioritizing defensive operations. This project ingests ATT&CK
technique sightings and process them to produce useful datasets and reporting.

This project is created and maintained by the `MITRE Engenuity Center for
Threat-Informed Defense <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`__ in futherance of our
mission to advance the state of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed
defense globally. The project is funded by our `research participants
<https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/sightings-ecosystem/#RESEARCH-PARTICIPANTS>`__.
You can be a part of the success of this project by contributing your Sightings data and
help advance the state of cybersecurity at large. Email ctid@mitre-engenuity.org for
