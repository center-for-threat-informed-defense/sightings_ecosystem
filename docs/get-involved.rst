Get Involved
============

If your organization has ATT&CK-mapped detection data and you want to discuss the possibility of becoming a data contributor, please email us at `ctid@mitre.org <mailto:ctid@mitre.org>`__

We are always looking for more contributors for the Sightings Ecosystem project,
and it is a tricky balance between encouraging maximum contribution and creating a data model that is more restrictive. This is why our data model has fields that are optional, even if the enhanced data would provide added benefits and additional analysis. This iteration,
we decided to include analysis of these areas, despite only having a small sub-set of
data with that information. In future iterations, we hope to receive more data labeled
with the optional data fields, allowing us to continue to provide new and better
analysis. We hope to continue expanding the Sightings Ecosystem to
provide insights and analysis to better inform the cyber security community.
